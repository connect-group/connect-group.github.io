This utilises the CSS3 selectors from Thymesheet to create simple, readable unit tests.\r\n\r\nThis complements automated testing such as Selenium and contributes to the quality and agile practices in use at Connect.\r\n\r\nFor more information about how we do this, [Learn more about Thymeleaf TDD](thymeleaf-tdd/)\r\n\r\n## Griddl\r\nAn awesome responsive framework, [Griddl](https://github.com/djeglin/Griddl) was developed at Connect and used on one of our most exciting projects, [Jaguar Global Websites](http://www.jaguar.co.uk)\r\n## Umbraco\r\nConnect are proud to both utilise and support the excellent open source content management system, [Umbraco](http://umbraco.com)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
